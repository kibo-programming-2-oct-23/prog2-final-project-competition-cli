# Milestone 1: Read and understand.

You will be provided with quite a bit of code to start with. Not all of the classes and methods you will find in this repo are complete, and most importantly: None are tested.

Your goal for this first milestone is to:
1. Read through this section and undertand the purpose of all the code provided to you.
2. Write unit tests for the following functions and methods:

# Milestone 2: A functional CLI.
By the end of this milestone, you should have a functional CLI you can use to create a valid tournament, and save its information in such a way we can exit the program, then restart it.

# Milestone 3: Scheduling the tournament.
By the end of this milestone, you should be able to set a date for when the tournament start, and create events on EventBrite to keep track of all the correct games.
