# Project overview

The main challenge is this process is going to be in reading and understanding. We will provide you with quite a bit of code, and guide you through what you need to do to complete it. Your focus should be on starting this early, really understanding each step, and making sure you are very comfortable with any piece of code we direct you to read and modify. 

I hope you will have fun, learn something, and enjoy building your biggest program yet!
